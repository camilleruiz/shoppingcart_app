Rene Des Cart:
A Shopping Cart application developed by Camille Ruiz

Progress:
- Login/Logout using Devise gem
- Started incorporating bootstrap
- Listing items

Problems/challenges encountered:
- login/logout working on localhost, didn't work in heroku
	- fixed through routes
- didn't understand how bootstrap works (still feeling my way through it)
- didn't know how to display objects/instances from database

Next steps:
- logic of putting item in cart
- design
